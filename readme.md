# AmeriCommerce Client API Samples #

This repository contains examples of how the AmeriCommerce Client API can be used to fetch information about an AmeriCommerce store.

Individual examples are separated into directories under src. These examples make use of jQuery.

## Examples ##

### adding to cart ###

This example explores a basic use case of adding an item to the cart, displaying the new count of items in the cart, and clearing the cart.

### updating ###

A more advanced example where we lay out a full cart display and attach events to update quantities and remove items from the cart.

## Notes ##

### Conventions ###

Generally a variable that represents a jQuery object will be prefixed with a $. This is purely a convenience that allows us to identify these objects at a glance.

### Version 2012.6 Compatibility ###
